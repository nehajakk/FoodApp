# Comp 426 Final Project- Foodie
This is our full repository for our Comp 426 final project.
The project is live at: https://foodapp-35256.web.app/

## Description
In this project, we are creating an interactive recipe app so that our users can easily find recipes given what ingredients they have at the time. Once they ingredient/food item has been searched, options of foods to make with that item will appear. To do this, we connected the site to a third party service called Edamam. On the site, once a user finds the recipe of the food they like they will be able to like it and all the liked recipes will show up on my profile so that the user can reference these later. The recipes include a calories number and diet labels so that users can track overall nutrition. Additionally, the recipes include ingredients and links so that the user is able to quickly and efficiently make it. The user is required to create a profile which is then saved within our firebase database to save all relevant information. This was the user can easily go back to liked recipes and remember overall nutrition goals.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
