# Comp 426 Final Project- Foodie

This is our full repository for our Comp 426 final project.
The project is live at: https://foodapp-35256.web.app/

## Description

In this project, we are creating an interactive recipe app so that our users can easily find recipes given what ingredients they have at the time. Once they ingredient/food item has been searched, options of foods to make with that item will appear. To do this, we connected the site to a third party service called Edamam. On the site, once a user finds the recipe of the food they like they will be able to like it and all the liked recipes will show up on my profile so that the user can reference these later. The recipes include a calories number and diet labels so that users can track overall nutrition. Additionally, the recipes include ingredients and links so that the user is able to quickly and efficiently make it. The user is required to create a profile which is then saved within our firebase database to save all relevant information. This was the user can easily go back to liked recipes and remember overall nutrition goals.

## Development
